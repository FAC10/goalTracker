### Goal Tracker
Goal Tracker is an app for keeping track of your goals and deadlines. With a focus on using positive reinforcement to promote productivity and a balanced lifestyle, Goal Tracker can be used by anyone, but is aimed particularly at young people who live with depression or low self esteem.

Goal Tracker uses a basic reward system to encourage users to be more productive. The user's completed goal-count is displayed in the top corner of the screen. Users are given an image of an animal which is initially obscured, using low-poly distortion. With every task that the user completes, the resolution of the animal image improves to reveal the animal. And for every 10 goals completed, more animal images are unlocked.

Goals are divided into four categories to encourage a healthy consideration for varied lifestyle and work / life balance:

* Productivity
* Learning
* Health
* Leisure

It takes inspiration from other similar apps:
* Duolingo (Language learning)
* Couch 2 5K (Running/exercise)
* Google Calendar (organization/planning/remainders).

It will point and/or link the user to these apps should they need more control on a specific task, but its main aim is to keep all the planning/goals in one place and being easy to follow and work towards.
