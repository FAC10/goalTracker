### Goal Tracker
Goal Tracker is an app for keeping track of your goals and tasks. With a focus on using positive reinforcement to promote productivity and a balanced lifestyle, Goal Tracker can be used by anyone, but is aimed particularly at young people who live with depression or low self esteem.

Goal Tracker uses a basic reward system to encourage users to become more productive. The design of the app is based on top of animal drawings which are obscured from view by tiles. As users set and complete tasks, the tiles disappear to reveal the animal behind.

Goals are divided into four categories to encourage a healthy consideration for varied lifestyle and work / life balance:

* Productivity
* Learning
* Health
* Leisure

It takes inspiration from other similar apps:
* Duolingo (Language learning)
* Couch 2 5K (Running/exercise)
* Google Calendar (organization/planning/remainders).

It will point and/or link the user to these apps should they need more control on a specific task, but its main aim is to keep all the planning/goals in one place and being easy to follow and work towards.
